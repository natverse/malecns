\usage{
mcns_predict_group(
  ids,
  method = c("auto", "fullauto", "group", "manc", "instance", "type", "pmanc", "all"),
  badtypes = c(NA, "", "Lamina_R1-R6", "Descending", "KC", "ER", "LC", "PB",
    "Ascending Interneuron", "Delta", "P1_L candidate", "LT", "MeMe", "PFGs", "Mi", "VT",
    "ML", "EL", "FB", "Dm", "DNp", "FC", "OL", "T", "Y")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ids}{Body ids in any form understood by \code{\link{mcns_ids}}. If you
have a metadata dataframe as returned by \code{\link{mcns_neuprint_meta}}
then this is ideal as that function is called under the hood.}

\item{method}{A string specifying which of 5 methods to use to identify the
group. \code{"all"} means to return all 5, while \code{"fullauto"} means to
look at each method in turn successively filling in missing group values.
Method \code{"auto"} (the default) excludes predicted manc matches (see
details).}

\item{badtypes}{Values of the type column which should be ignored for the
purposes of defining cell type groups. This will be because they contain
bad values or because the types are too broad to be very useful.}
}
\value{
For \code{method="all"} a dataframe as returned by
  \code{\link{mcns_neuprint_meta}} with additional columns
  \code{instance_group} and \code{type_group}. Otherwise a numeric vector.
}
\description{
Predict the group of neurons using instance or type information
}
\details{
Grouping information for neurons in the male cns is presently
  scattered in several locations. These include the numeric group field, the
  type field or the instance field. If the type field has the same value, the
  neurons should form a group. However there are some values that are known
  to be bad and these are excluded.

  An additional source of group information comes from matches of VNC neurons
  to the MANC dataset. These either come as curated matches (where the
  \code{manc_group} column has been entered in Clio, \code{method="manc"}) or
  as predicted matches (based on the \code{manc_bodyid} column,
  \code{method="pmanc"}).

  \code{method="pmanc"} should be used with caution since a significant
  percentage of these matches are wrong. However, since the majority should
  be correct, they may still be a useful source of group information e.g. for
  connectivity clustering which is typically not that sensitive to errors.

  Given this situation \code{method='auto'} (the default) only uses curated
  matches (\code{method="manc"}). Select \code{method='fullauto'} to use the
  predicted MANC matches as a fall-back.
