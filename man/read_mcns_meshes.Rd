\title{Read a mesh for the current segmentation}
\usage{
read_mcns_meshes(
  ids,
  type = c("auto", "dvid", "small"),
  node = "neutu",
  df = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ids}{A set of body ids in any form understandable to
\code{\link[malevnc]{manc_ids}}}

\item{type}{One of \code{"auto"}, \code{"dvid"} or \code{"small"} (see
details).}

\item{node}{A DVID node as returned by \code{\link[malevnc]{manc_dvid_node}}. The
default is to return the current active (unlocked) node being used through
neutu.}

\item{df}{A data.frame containing information about the neurons for which
meshes will be fetched. Optional and if \code{ids} is a data.frame, then
that will be used.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{httr::GET}}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{neuronlist}} containing one or more \code{mesh3d}
  objects.
}
\description{
Read a mesh for the current segmentation
}
\details{
\code{dvid} meshes are pre-computed but are automatically deleted
  and recomputed after boides are edited. However this process has a
  noticeable lag. \code{small} meshes are generated on demand in a process
  that can be quite slow. \code{auto} will try the \code{dvid} method and
  switch to \code{small} if that fails. See
  \href{https://flyem-cns.slack.com/archives/C01BZB05M8C/p1651719608800039}{slack}
  for details.
